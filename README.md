# Tic_Tac_Toe-Python-

A simple Tic Tac Toe game without GUI in python.

To run the game just execute the code.

3 levels of difficulty: 
- 0 (easy, CPU makes random choices)
- 1 (moderate, CPU makes some random choices, but tries to win and not lose)
- 9000 (literally unbeatable, CPU is programmed to never lose)

Got valuable assistance from this link:

Don't know why I did that, I guess i got kinda bored and wanted to freshen my coding skills.

Not the most beautiful code, I know.

In case of mistakes, though I doubt there are any, feel free to let me know.
